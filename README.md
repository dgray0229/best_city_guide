A sample website working with columns and floats to create a clean, responsive layout. This is another design in which I practice using floats and clearfixes to layout my structure for different devices and screen widths.

This layout took about two hours to create. I enjoyed working on this project because of the bright colors, and the challenge of creating responsive layouts that use working columns.
